Awesome Swarm Robotics
======================

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)


In addition to other [repositories in the HROS.dev organization](https://github.com/orgs/HROSdev/repositories), we are starting to put together [different listings of awesome Swarm Robotics Resources](https://github.com/HROSdev/awesome-swarm-robotics) ... which will focus AT FIRST particularly on the problem of herding/controlling/protecting livestock in extensive harsh, predator-rich chaotic outdoor environents. 


This repository's [Awesome Robotics page](AwesomeRobotics.md) is our fork of the [kiloreux's Awesome Robotics repository](https://github.com/kiloreux/awesome-robotics) which is listing AWESOME various books, courses and other resources for robotics. 

I'd be happy to create a Table of Contents with hyperlinks to the headings in this Markdown document. Here it is:
