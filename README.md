In addition to other [repositories in the HROS.dev organization](https://github.com/orgs/HROSdev/repositories), we are starting to put together a [list of awesome Swarm Robotics Resources](https://github.com/HROSdev/awesome-swarm-robotics), which will focus particularly on the problem of herding/controlling/protecting livestock in extensive harsh, predator-rich chaotic outdoor environents. 


This repository's [Awesome Robotics page](AwesomeRobotics.md) is our fork of the [Awesome Robotics repository] listing AWESOME various books, courses and other resources for robotics.
